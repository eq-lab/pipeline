## UX Testing Log

### 2026-05-12 — Issue #40 (Self-host the Figma typefaces in packages/ui)

- **Scope:** Issue #40 acceptance criteria (TC-40-1 through TC-40-10)
- **Cases executed:** 10
- **Passes:** 8
- **Failures:** 2
- **Blocked:** 0
- **Bugs filed:** #68 (medium), #69 (low)
- **Score: 7/10**
  - All 5 font files present (besley-regular, besley-bold, graphik-regular, graphik-regular-italic, graphik-medium); LICENSE.md present with both family sections.
  - Zero Google Fonts CDN references in source (`fonts.googleapis.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`).
  - All font requests served from localhost with HTTP 200; no CDN requests detected in DevTools Network.
  - CSS custom properties `--font-display` and `--font-body` resolve correctly in both Storybook and frontend app.
  - Storybook build succeeds; frontend build succeeds and emits all 5 `.woff2` files into `dist/assets/`.
  - All 5 `@font-face` blocks include `font-display: swap`.
  - Besley renders correctly at w400 and w700; Graphik LC renders at w400, w500, and italic w400.
  - **FAIL TC-40-1/TC-40-2:** Graphik LC semibold (w600) font file is missing — no `graphik-semibold.woff2`, no `@font-face` for w600, and the Typography story renders Body Emphasized at w500 instead of w600 (Figma spec: 16/22 w600). Filed as #68.
  - **FAIL TC-40-10:** `docs/FRONTEND.md` has no Typography section — the plan required appending one under "Visual direction". Filed as #69.
  - Deducted 3 points: missing w600 weight is a spec mismatch (medium severity); missing docs update is a plan deliverable gap (low severity).

### 2026-05-12 — Issue #39 (Download Figma assets into packages/ui/src/assets/)

- **Scope:** Issue #39 acceptance criteria (TC-39-1 through TC-39-8)
- **Cases executed:** 8
- **Passes:** 8
- **Failures:** 0
- **Blocked:** 0
- **Bugs filed:** none
- **Score: 10/10**
  - All 7 required asset files present with exact kebab-case names.
  - All files are valid SVG (start with `<svg`); no binary blobs.
  - Zero Figma CDN URLs remain in any source file.
  - Nav icons and `arrow-up-right.svg` correctly use `fill="currentColor"`; logo and illustration retain literal brand fills.
  - No fixed `width`/`height` on any root `<svg>` — all use `viewBox` only.
  - Visual rendering verified via Chrome DevTools MCP: logo wordmark correct, all four nav icons correct shapes, arrow-up-right correct, striped-wallet illustration renders as intended line-pattern artwork.
  - No JS console errors on dev server (only expected Vite HMR debug message).
  - Docs lint passes with 0 errors.

### 2026-05-12 — Issue #38 (Bootstrap TanStack Router file-based routes)

- **Scope:** Issue #38 acceptance criteria (TC-38-1, TC-38-2, TC-38-3)
- **Cases executed:** 3
- **Passes:** 3
- **Failures:** 0
- **Blocked:** 0
- **Bugs filed:** none
- **Score: 9/10**
  - All three acceptance criteria pass cleanly.
  - Build produces no ENOENT warnings; `dist/` is generated.
  - Dev server renders "Pipeline" at `/` with no JS errors (only a cosmetic favicon 404).
  - `routeTree.gen.ts` is present and non-empty (1503 bytes).
  - Deducted 1 point: missing favicon causes a browser console 404 error (cosmetic, low severity — not filed as a blocking bug; can be addressed when branding assets land).

## Backing invariant

| Status | Drift threshold |
|--------|----------------|
| Green | < 0.01% |
| Amber | 0.01% – 1.0% |
| Red | > 1.0% |

Amber and red states trigger an immediate alert to the on-call channel and to the trustee. The invariant is evaluated after every deposit, yield mint, loan disbursement, repayment, and withdrawal.

## Latency targets

| Operation | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| API p50 | ≤ 100ms |
| API p95 | ≤ 500ms |
| On-chain event → bridge action | ≤ 30s |
| Reconciliation invariant publish after state change | ≤ 60s |
| LP withdrawal (within automated bounds, USDC available) | ≤ 10 min |

## Frontend performance

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| LCP | ≤ 2.5s |
| FID / INP | ≤ 100ms |
| Initial JS bundle | ≤ 250 kB gzipped |

## Availability

| Service | Target |
|---------|--------|
| API + Worker | 99.9% monthly uptime |
| Weekly yield distribution (Thursday) | Zero missed distributions |
| Price feed polling | ≥ 95% of scheduled ticks delivered |

## Test coverage

| Package | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| `packages/worker` (bridge logic, waterfall, CCR) | 100% line coverage for core domain logic |
| `packages/api` (endpoint handlers) | 100% for auth and fund-transfer endpoints |
| Smart contracts | 100% branch coverage via Foundry/Hardhat test suite |
| `packages/frontend` | Unit tests for all calculation utilities |

## Smart contract audit

- Tier 1 auditor (Trail of Bits, ChainSecurity, OpenZeppelin, or equivalent)
- Scope: all 5 custom contracts (~470 lines custom code)
- Zero critical or high findings unresolved at launch

## Rate limits (enforced on-chain)

| Limit | Value | Configurable by |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Rolling 24h mint | $10M | Foundation multisig |
| Per-tx mint cap | $5M | Foundation multisig |
| Rolling 24h LP payout | $10M | Foundation multisig |
| Per-tx LP payout cap | $5M | Foundation multisig |
| Per-tx USYC swap | $5M | Foundation multisig |
| Daily aggregate USYC swap | $20M | Foundation multisig |
